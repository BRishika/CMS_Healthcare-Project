# CMS_Healthcare-Project


Objective:
CMS assigns a number to each US hospital on a range of 1 to 5, making it simpler for customers and patients to assess the relative value of the services each facility provides. Customers' choices of hospitals are directly influenced by the ratings, which can also have a big financial impact on hospitals. Therefore, in order to improve the elements that influence their ratings, hospitals must fully comprehend the process used by CMS to determine the ratings.The goal of this project is to provide a method for ranking hospitals and utilize it to pinpoint areas where specific hospitals need to improve. It will also necessitate a deep comprehension of the CMS-developed rating system.


# Steps Followed:

Analyzing and Cleaning Data
Investigative Data Analysis
Dividing the Data into Training and Testing Sets for Linear Regression -- Model Building -- RFE -- Feature Scaling -- Creating a model for the detailed statistics using statsmodel Manually removing variables from the model; Residual Analysis of the model's train data; and Predicting on a test set
